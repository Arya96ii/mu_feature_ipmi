# IPMI Feature Repo

This IPMI feature repo contains the generic IPMI code from TianoCore's
edk2-platforms repo which has been refactored to support more general use and
with added functionality.

## Repo Development

Unlike other Project MU repositories, the IPMI feature repo does not follow the
EDKII releases, but rather has a continuous main branch which will periodically
receive cherry-picks of needed changes from EDKII. For stable builds, release
tags will be used instead to determine commit hashes at stable points in
development. Release branches may be created as needed to facilitate a specific
release with needed features, but this should be avoided.

## Consuming the IPMI feature Package
